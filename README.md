## RLC Transient Response Calculator

This MATLAB-based program calculates the transient response of both series and parallel RLC circuits by taking the following parameters:

- **R** : Resistance
- **L** : Inductance
- **C** : Capacitance
- **i₀** : Initial Current through the Inductor (Amperes)
- **V₀** : Initial Voltage across the Capacitor (Volts)
- **Vₛ** or **Iₛ** : Source Voltage or Current

### Features:
1. **Circuit Type Selection**: Choose between series or parallel RLC circuits.

2. **Input Parameters**: Enter the required values.

3. **Output Results**:
   - **Series Circuit**: Current (Iₛ) and voltage across each element.
   - **Parallel Circuit**: Output voltage and current through each element.

With this tool, you can easily visualize and analyze the transient behavior of RLC circuits.

> [!NOTE]
You can use the following prefixes for entering the unit of each parameter in the same text box where you input the values:
- **p** : pico
- **n** : nano
- **u** : micro
- **m** : milli
- **k** : kilo

Open the `main.m` file and run it to start the program.
